### Agile development
User stories have been created in the GitHub Projects - links to the stories are provided in the [User Stories](#user-stories) table in the Issue ID column. The user stories have been split into categories using the MoSCoW prioritization method -
- Must-have
- Should-have 
- Could-have

The primary goal for the MVP was to concentrate on the development of essential features (Must-have items). The Should-have and Could-have shall be addressed in the future development cycles.

The procedural steps during development were as follows:

1. Transfer a crucial user story from the Sprint Backlog (User Stories) column to the To Do (User Story) column.
1. Based on the user story, generate tasks related to its fulfilment and store them in the To-do (Tasks and Spikes) column. Subsequently, break down each task into sub-tasks and document them on the task card.
1. Prepare multiple tasks and initiate their implementation. The one currently in progress is shifted to the In Progress (Tasks and Spikes) column. Mark off completed sub-tasks and document any issues or progress comments.
1. Upon task completion, relocate it to the Done (Tasks and Spikes) column and close it, providing comments if necessary.
1. Once all tasks associated with the user story are finished, move the user story to the Done (User Stories) column, including any pertinent comments.
1. Repeat the process until the project phase completion. 

This methodology centred on developing essential features first, enabling flexibility, and allowing incremental development. The approach incorporated transparent progress tracking through visual boards and early identification of issues. 

The details of the user stories and associated priority labels can be found in [Projects](https://github.com/users/AleksandrAtr/projects/7/views/1?layout=board).

   - Go to the "Properties" tab for your bucket.
   - Activate "Static website hosting".
   - Set 'index.html' as the index document.
   - Click "Save".

4. **Configure CORS**:
   - Move to the "Permissions" tab and click on "CORS configuration".
   - Input the following JSON and save:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "AllowedHeaders": ["Authorization"],
         "AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
         "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
         "ExposeHeaders": []
       }
     ]
     ```

5. **Set Up Bucket Policy**:
   - Still under the "Permissions" tab, click "Bucket Policy".
   - Generate a Bucket Policy using the policy generator:
     - Select "S3 Bucket Policy" as the type.
     - Set principal to "*".

   - Copy and paste the generated policy JSON into the bucket policy editor.
   - Save your changes.

6. **Adjust Access Control List (ACL)**:
   - Under "Access control list (ACL)", grant "List" permissions to "Everyone (public access)".
   - Confirm to acknowledge public access.
   - Save the configuration.

**Configuring AWS IAM for Secure Access**

1. **Create an IAM User Group**:
   - From the IAM dashboard, select "User Groups".
   - Create a new group (e.g., `manage-darianna-creative`).
   - Proceed without adding a policy directly; create the group.

2. **Create and Attach a Policy**:
   - Select "Policies" and then "Create policy".
   - Use the JSON tab to import the "AmazonS3FullAccess" managed policy.
   - Modify the resource block to include your bucket's ARN, like so:
     ```json
     "Resource": [
       "arn:aws:s3:::darianna-creative",
       "arn:aws:s3:::darianna-creative/*"
     ]
     ```
   - Name your policy (e.g., `darianna-creative-policy`) and create it.

3. **Attach Policy to Group**:
   - Go back to your user group, select it, and attach the newly created policy under "Permissions".

4. **Create an IAM User**:
   - In "Users", create a new user (e.g., `manage-darianna-creative-user`) with "Programmatic access".
   - Add this user to the group you created.
   - Finalize user creation and download the .csv file containing their access key and secret. This is crucial as it cannot be downloaded again later.

    ```

4. **Create a Superuser:**

    Create a superuser for your new database:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    Follow the prompts to set up your superuser's username, password, and email (optional).

5. **Revert `settings.py` Changes:**

    To maintain security and prevent exposure of our database URL, revert the DATABASES setting in `settings.py` to utilize the local SQLite database again.


`
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
    }
}`

You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Login to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/janebmckenna/MilestoneProject4)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

You can update your requirements.txt file using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** should be a project level file and can be created using:
- `echo web: gunicorn the_club.wsgi:application --log-file - > Procfile`

**Note: this project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.**

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

- You will need to set your own environment variables for:

` DATABASE_URL
  STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  STRIPE_WH_SECRET`


If you use AWS to host your static/media files you will also need to set

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

Otherwise these must be adjusted as appropriate within settings.py

### Static and Media Files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

If you use gmail as your service provider for email then you will also need to set environment variables for:

    EMAIL_HOST_USER 
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD 
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
 
### Setting up Stripe Payments on your deployed site

1. Log in to Stripe, click on the developers tab and API keys copy the API key and set them in Heroku as config variables in the following:
   - `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`: Stripe publishable key goes here
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Stripe secret key goes here

2. Back in Stripe set up a new webhook for your deployed site by clicking on webhooks, click on 'add endpoint' and paste in your deployed site's URL setting it to listen for all events.

3. Click on your newly set up webhook and click on 'Signing Secret' at the top to reveal the secret value. Copy it and set it as a new config variable in Heroku:
   - `STRIPE_WH_SECRET`: Signing secret from new webhook.

### Website development:
During the project development, references were made to various online learning resources to get inspiration for the design and problems solving.  

- I learned much of the material from the Code Code Institute Boutique Ado project. 
- The HTML and CSS basics learn from the Code Institute education portal - https://learn.codeinstitute.net/dashboard
- Items alignment in elements - https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center.en.html
