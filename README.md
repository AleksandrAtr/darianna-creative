### Agile development
User stories have been created in the GitHub Projects - links to the stories are provided in the [User Stories](#user-stories) table in the Issue ID column. The user stories have been split into categories using the MoSCoW prioritization method -
- Must-have
- Should-have 
- Could-have

The primary goal for the MVP was to concentrate on the development of essential features (Must-have items). The Should-have and Could-have shall be addressed in the future development cycles.

The procedural steps during development were as follows:

1. Transfer a crucial user story from the Sprint Backlog (User Stories) column to the To Do (User Story) column.
1. Based on the user story, generate tasks related to its fulfilment and store them in the To-do (Tasks and Spikes) column. Subsequently, break down each task into sub-tasks and document them on the task card.
1. Prepare multiple tasks and initiate their implementation. The one currently in progress is shifted to the In Progress (Tasks and Spikes) column. Mark off completed sub-tasks and document any issues or progress comments.
1. Upon task completion, relocate it to the Done (Tasks and Spikes) column and close it, providing comments if necessary.
1. Once all tasks associated with the user story are finished, move the user story to the Done (User Stories) column, including any pertinent comments.
1. Repeat the process until the project phase completion. 

This methodology centred on developing essential features first, enabling flexibility, and allowing incremental development. The approach incorporated transparent progress tracking through visual boards and early identification of issues. 

The details of the user stories and associated priority labels can be found in [Projects](https://github.com/users/AleksandrAtr/projects/2/views/3?filterQuery=-status%3A%22Awaiting+Review+%28Tasks+and+Spikes%29%22).




<!-- DEPLOYMENT -->


## Deployment

Deployment facilitates the transition of your project from your local environment or IDE to publicly accessible hosting for others to access and enjoy. Below are the detailed steps you'll need to follow. These instructions assume you're using an IDE like VS Code or cloud based GitPod.


- **Hosting Platform:**
   - Heroku -  [https://www.heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/)

- **Database Hosting:**
   - ElephantSQL (PostgreSQL database) - [https://www.elephantsql.com/](https://www.elephantsql.com/)

- **Static File Hosting:**
   - AWS (Amazon Web Services) - [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com//)


### Project Preparation in Your IDE

#### Note: Python Installation Required

Please note that it's assumed Python is installed on the computer or IDE cloud based platform for deploying this project. If you haven't installed Python yet, you'll need to download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) before proceeding with the deployment process.


1. **Install Required Packages**

Open your IDE and execute the following commands in your terminal:

`pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2`


- `dj_database_url` facilitates connecting to various databases using their URL.
- `psycopg2` is a PostgreSQL adapter for Python.

2. **Update Requirements**

Update your `requirements.txt` to include the newly installed packages.

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

3. **Modify `settings.py`**

In your `settings.py`, import `dj_database_url` under the import for `os`.

```
import os
import dj_database_url
```

### Setting up the ElephantSQL Database

Log into ElephantSQL and create database instance.
1. Click on "Create New Instance".
2. Input an instance name.
3. Select the free Tiny Turtle plan.
4. Leave the tags field blank.
5. Select a region closest to you for the data center.
6. Review your instance details and confirm by creating the instance.
7. Copy the URL of the newly created database instance for later use.

### Setting up an Amazon S3 Bucket for Static Website Hosting

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up an Amazon S3 bucket for hosting a static website, including necessary permissions and security configurations using AWS IAM.

**Creating and Configuring the S3 Bucket**

1. **Create an AWS Account**:
   - Sign up or log into your Amazon AWS account.

2. **Create a New S3 Bucket**:
   - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click "Create bucket".
   - Provide a unique bucket name and select an appropriate region.
   - Uncheck "Block all public access" under the permissions settings to allow public access.
   - Acknowledge the warning that the bucket will be publicly accessible.

3. **Enable Static Website Hosting**:
   - Go to the "Properties" tab for your bucket.
   - Activate "Static website hosting".
   - Set 'index.html' as the index document.
   - Click "Save".

4. **Configure CORS**:
   - Move to the "Permissions" tab and click on "CORS configuration".
   - Input the following JSON and save:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "AllowedHeaders": ["Authorization"],
         "AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
         "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
         "ExposeHeaders": []
       }
     ]
     ```

5. **Set Up Bucket Policy**:
   - Still under the "Permissions" tab, click "Bucket Policy".
   - Generate a Bucket Policy using the policy generator:
     - Select "S3 Bucket Policy" as the type.
     - Set principal to "*".
     - Paste the ARN from your bucket.
     - Add the statement and generate the policy.
   - Copy and paste the generated policy JSON into the bucket policy editor.
   - Save your changes.

6. **Adjust Access Control List (ACL)**:
   - Under "Access control list (ACL)", grant "List" permissions to "Everyone (public access)".
   - Confirm to acknowledge public access.
   - Save the configuration.

**Configuring AWS IAM for Secure Access**

1. **Create an IAM User Group**:
   - From the IAM dashboard, select "User Groups".
   - Create a new group (e.g., `manage-darianna-creative`).
   - Proceed without adding a policy directly; create the group.

2. **Create and Attach a Policy**:
   - Select "Policies" and then "Create policy".
   - Use the JSON tab to import the "AmazonS3FullAccess" managed policy.
   - Modify the resource block to include your bucket's ARN, like so:
     ```json
     "Resource": [
       "arn:aws:s3:::darianna-creative",
       "arn:aws:s3:::darianna-creative/*"
     ]
     ```
   - Name your policy (e.g., `darianna-creative-policy`) and create it.

3. **Attach Policy to Group**:
   - Go back to your user group, select it, and attach the newly created policy under "Permissions".

4. **Create an IAM User**:
   - In "Users", create a new user (e.g., `manage-darianna-creative-user`) with "Programmatic access".
   - Add this user to the group you created.
   - Finalize user creation and download the .csv file containing their access key and secret. This is crucial as it cannot be downloaded again later.

### Heroku Deployment

1. **Log into Heroku Account**

   - Open your web browser and log into your Heroku account.

2. **Create New App**

   - Click on the "New" button and select 'Create New App'.

3. **Name Your App**

   - Choose a unique name for your app.
   - Set the region to Europe or your preferred region.

4. **Choose Deployment Method**

   - Select GitHub as the deployment method.
   - Search for your repository name.

5. **Update Config Variables**

   - After selecting your repository, navigate to the settings tab.
   - Update the config variables as needed.

6. **Enable Automatic Deployment**

   - Go back to the deploy tab.
   - Enable automatic deployment for seamless updates.


### Update DATABASE Settings in Django project

1. **Update Database Setting:**

    Comment out the original SQLite connection and add a new connection to use ElephantSQL:

    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse('your-database-url-here')
    }
    ```

    **_IMPORTANT:_** Do not commit this change with your database URL. This step is temporary for migration purposes.

2. **Verify Database Connection:**

    Run the following command to ensure you're connected to the external database:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py showmigrations
    ```

    You should see a list of migrations none of which are applied yet.

3. **Migrate Database Models:**

    Execute the migrate command to apply database models to your new database:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```

4. **Create a Superuser:**

    Create a superuser for your new database:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    Follow the prompts to set up your superuser's username, password, and email (optional).

5. **Revert `settings.py` Changes:**

    To maintain security and prevent exposure of our database URL, revert the DATABASES setting in `settings.py` to utilize the local SQLite database again.


`
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
    }
}`

3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

You can update your requirements.txt file using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** should be a project level file and can be created using:
- `echo web: gunicorn the_club.wsgi:application --log-file - > Procfile`

**Note: this project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.**

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

- You will need to set your own environment variables for:

` DATABASE_URL
  STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  STRIPE_WH_SECRET`


If you use AWS to host your static/media files you will also need to set

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

Otherwise these must be adjusted as appropriate within settings.py

### Static and Media Files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

If you use gmail as your service provider for email then you will also need to set environment variables for:

    EMAIL_HOST_USER 
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD 
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
