### Agile development
User stories have been created in the GitHub Projects - links to the stories are provided in the [User Stories](#user-stories) table in the Issue ID column. The user stories have been split into categories using the MoSCoW prioritization method -
- Must-have
- Should-have 
- Could-have

The primary goal for the MVP was to concentrate on the development of essential features (Must-have items). The Should-have and Could-have shall be addressed in the future development cycles.

The procedural steps during development were as follows:

1. Transfer a crucial user story from the Sprint Backlog (User Stories) column to the To Do (User Story) column.
1. Based on the user story, generate tasks related to its fulfilment and store them in the To-do (Tasks and Spikes) column. Subsequently, break down each task into sub-tasks and document them on the task card.
1. Prepare multiple tasks and initiate their implementation. The one currently in progress is shifted to the In Progress (Tasks and Spikes) column. Mark off completed sub-tasks and document any issues or progress comments.
1. Upon task completion, relocate it to the Done (Tasks and Spikes) column and close it, providing comments if necessary.
1. Once all tasks associated with the user story are finished, move the user story to the Done (User Stories) column, including any pertinent comments.
1. Repeat the process until the project phase completion. 

This methodology centred on developing essential features first, enabling flexibility, and allowing incremental development. The approach incorporated transparent progress tracking through visual boards and early identification of issues. 

The details of the user stories and associated priority labels can be found in [Projects](https://github.com/users/AleksandrAtr/projects/2/views/3?filterQuery=-status%3A%22Awaiting+Review+%28Tasks+and+Spikes%29%22).
